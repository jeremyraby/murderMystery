## About

This is a collection of notes and the queries I used to solve the [SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/). I tried to think through it step-by-step and document my process along with the actual queries. After completing Google's Data Analytics Certification course, this still seemed incredibly daunting and I had no idea how to start. After working through a few other short SQL courses and doing some guided projects, I finally felt up to trying this out again. It's not flashy, but this marks the first "project" I've done that I'm really proud of and I finally feel like I'm making progress on my learning journey.
